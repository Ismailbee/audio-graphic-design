# Performance Optimizations for Audio Graphic Design

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the application's responsiveness and reduce browser slowdowns.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Canvas Rendering

- **Batch Drawing**: Using `requestAnimationFrame` to batch canvas updates with a debounce pattern
- **Optimized Grid Rendering**: 
  - Caching grid dimensions to prevent unnecessary redraws
  - Single path batching for grid lines instead of drawing each line separately
  - Optimized rendering with single Shape for better performance
- **View Culling Implementation**:
  - Only rendering objects that are visible in the current viewport
  - Automatic culling on zoom/pan operations
  - Safety margins to prevent popping at viewport edges

### 2. Image Handling

- **Enhanced Image Compression**:
  - Implemented OffscreenCanvas when available
  - Optimized image compression with quality/size balance
  - Proper caching with optimized settings

### 3. Event Handling

- **Throttled Events**:
  - Added throttling to keyboard events
  - Added throttling to mouse wheel zoom
  - Improved touch and drag events with RAF-based updates
  - Preventing redundant handlers through better cleanup

### 4. Text Editing

- **Optimized Text Input**:
  - Debounced textarea input events
  - Properly cleaned up text editing elements and events
  - Removed memory leaks from text editing operations

### 5. Resource Loading

- **Optimized Font Loading**:
  - Non-blocking font loading with `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"`
  - Preconnect to font sources
  - Removed duplicate font imports

- **Deferred Script Loading**:
  - Added defer attribute to non-critical scripts
  - Eliminated duplicate Konva loading (from CDN and module)

### 6. Memory Management

- **Proper Cleanup**:
  - Enhanced event listener cleanup in component unmount
  - Fixed memory leaks from canvas objects
  - Proper destruction of Konva instances
  - **Memory Monitoring**:
    - Implemented WeakRef-based tracking to prevent leaks
    - Added memory usage alerts for significant increases
    - Automatic cleanup of unreferenced objects

### 7. Konva Configuration

- **Global Konva Settings**:
  - Disabled auto-draws to use batch draws
  - Lowered pixel ratio for better performance
  - Disabled listening on shapes that don't need it

### 8. DOM Efficiency

- **Reduced DOM Updates**:
  - Limited canvas size changes
  - Throttled property panel updates

### 9. Object Property Updates

- **Batch Property Updates**:
  - Added `updateObjectProperties` to batch multiple property changes with a single redraw
  - Temporarily disable listening during updates
  - Single cache operation after multiple property changes
  - Optimized transformer updates with selection caching

### 10. Drag Performance

- **Efficient Drag Operations**:
  - Throttled move events during drag
  - RAF-based position updates to smooth performance
  - Optimized stage position calculations

## Browser-specific Optimizations

### Chrome/Edge
- Used OffscreenCanvas for image processing when available
- Optimized for Chromium's rendering pipeline
- Implemented performance.memory tracking

### Firefox
- Adjusted canvas cache parameters for Firefox's rendering engine
- Image smoothing quality set to "medium" for Firefox performance

### Safari
- Used specific image compression settings for WebKit

## Monitoring Recommendations

To monitor performance:
1. Use the browser's Performance tab in Developer Tools
2. Monitor FPS during heavy operations
3. Check memory usage for leaks using our memory monitoring utilities
4. Look for long task durations in performance recordings

## Further Improvement Opportunities

1. Web Workers: Move heavy processing to background threads
2. IndexedDB Caching: Cache processed images to avoid recompression
3. Advanced compression algorithms for better image optimization
4. GPU Acceleration: Further optimize for hardware acceleration
5. Progressive Loading: Load resources as needed during runtime
